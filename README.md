# Jotthoughts

### This is a copy of the Google Keep application that I built. Users can create collections and create notes within these collections. It features both a card and list view for notes, a dark and light theme, and a search feature. There is no authentication as it's meant for demo purposes, but that would be the next step if I were to move this into production.
